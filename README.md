### Softwares Used

**Eclipse** is a Java-based open source platform that allows a software developer to create a customized development environment (IDE) from plug-in components built by Eclipse members.

The **H2 Database** is a relational database management system written in Java. It can be embedded in Java applications or run in the client-server mode. [Click here to download H2 Database](http://www.h2database.com/h2-setup-2014-04-05.exe)

**Tomcat 9.0 Apache Tomcat** is an open-source web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Tomcat implements several Java EE specifications including Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Java EL, and WebSocket, and provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment for Java code to run in.

### Frameworks Used

**Spring Framework v4.3.2** 
The Spring Framework is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. Spring handles the infrastructure so you can focus on your application. Spring enables you to build applications from "plain old Java objects" (POJOs) and to apply enterprise services non-invasively to POJOs. This capability applies to the Java SE programming model and to full and partial Java EE.

**Hibernate Framework v5.0.3** 
Hibernate ORM (Hibernate in short) is an object-relational mapping framework for the Java language. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database. Hibernate solves object-relational impedance mismatch problems by replacing direct, persistent database accesses with high-level object handling functions.
